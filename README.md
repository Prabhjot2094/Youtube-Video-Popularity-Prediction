## Executing the code
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- OpenCV is also required. It is not a part of requirements.txt
- Goto the project directory (popularity_prediction)

- Add config.py file to video_processing folder
    - Set the OPENFACEPATH (e.g. OPENFACEPATH = "~/OpenFace/build/bin/FaceLandmarkVidMulti")
    - This file is not tracked on github because everyone has different local values
- Execute video_processing/processed_videos.py
